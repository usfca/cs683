All in all, Spring Boot is a project built on the top of the Spring framework. It provides a simpler and
faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.

In the Spring core framework, you need to configure all the things for yourself. Hence, you can have a lot
of configuration files, such as XML descriptors. That’s one out of the main problems that Spring Boot solves for you.

It smartly chooses your dependencies, auto-configures all the features you will want to use, and you can start
your application with one click. Furthermore, it also simplifies the deployment process of your application.

It can be a bit frightening for a few of you, because it seems that there a lot of “magic” things happening in
the background. Despite that, I will explain the best features of the framework. I hope you take the advantage of
this additional knowledge on Spring Boot in your future projects. It really makes your life simpler.
